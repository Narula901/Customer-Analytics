# ðŸ›’ Customer Segmentation using RFM and Clustering (KMeans & DBSCAN)

This project focuses on analyzing transactional data from a retail database using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis to segment customers and identify key patterns in their purchasing behavior. The goal is to help the business improve marketing strategies, enhance customer engagement, and increase retention.

## ðŸ“Š Problem Statement

Businesses often treat all customers the same, which can lead to missed opportunities for targeted marketing. This project aims to cluster customers into distinct groups based on how recently they made a purchase (Recency), how often (Frequency), and how much they spent (Monetary).
